/*
    Radix sort works by classifying elements according to their individual digits. 
    Radix always starts with the ones digit until it reaches the maximum value
    element in the array. For this to work, we extract the ones digit and then place 
    it inside a `bucket`â€”definition below. We do this to the tens, the hundreds, 
    and so on and so forth with placing them back into the initial array as an
    in-between step. 

    Unlike other sorting algorithms, there is a stable and non-stable way for 
    Radix sort. The simple difference between them is that the non-stable radix
    sort starts at the end of the array. How does this lead to non-stability?
    Remember that radix sort works by sorting by individual digits which in turn
    should place lower value elements towards the start of the array. By starting
    from the end, all the work that was placed into sorting them by the previous
    digit will have gone to waste and therefore can yield an unsorted array. 

    The time complexity for radix sort is usually O(n * k), where `n` is the number
    of input data and `k` is the number of digits in the highest element. Assignment
    operators and simple mathematical operations are usually in constant time. This 
    algorithm does not require recursion nor does it need any comparisons between elements.
