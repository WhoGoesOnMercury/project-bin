/*
    Quick sort is the first recursive sorting that we will be dealing with. The 
    concept of quick sort revolves around the idea of a divide-and-conquerâ€”simply
    it is when we "divide" a problem into smaller and more "conquerable" problems.
    
    Our problem here is to sort. First, we choose a value from the array and we 
    will call this our pivot (there are various ways to go about this but random 
    will always yield the most consistent results). Every value in the left of the
    pivot that is larger will be swapped to the right, and every value in the right
    that is larger will be swapped to the left. We will now have two arrays: one
    that has values lower than our pivot and another with higher values. In the
    lower-value array, we choose another pivot at random and then do the same
    as our initial array. We also do this for the higher-value array. We continue
    this process until there are no more sub-arrays formed. 

    Time complexity...
