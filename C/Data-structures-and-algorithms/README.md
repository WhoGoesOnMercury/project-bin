# Data Structure And Algorithms in C

This repository was made for myself and for those who want to learn data structures
and algorithms. It is still a work in progress.

To give you a brief introduction, data structures and algorithms is a course
that every computer science student must go through. It is the core of every 
application. Sorting and searching specific data requires algorithms. Data 
structures are also varied depending on the need of the application. 

One of my reference materials is the book "Introduction to Algorithms 4th Edition",
written by Thomas H. Cormen, Charles E. Leiserson, Ronald L. Rivest, and Clifford
Stein. Another are the lecture notes from an "Introduction to Algorithms" class
in MIT which I accessed using a link I found from Reddit.

It is noteworthy that you should read the comments in the files themselves. The
READMEs can only discuss so much without first familiarizing yourself with the
code itself.
