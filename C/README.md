# Why use C?

In order to understand complex systems, one must dilute it down to its basic
constituents. The C language is greatly known for its manually-written 
nature. It lacks the abstraction that higher level programming language has, 
although libraries has made this easier. 

This whole project could be written in C++ (an Object-oriented programming language) 
but I concur. 

Given that you have stumbled upon this repository, I would assume that you already
have a working compiler for the C language, and also that you know how to run and
compile C codes. 

The `gcc` version I use is `gcc (tdm64-1) 10.3.0`.
